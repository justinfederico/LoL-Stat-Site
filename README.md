This project is currently being developed for myself and Jarel to learn full stack development in a way related to the things we like. League of Legends is one of those things. The functionality is limited, and documentation sparse, and I cannot guarantee all the features work properly. This repo will deprecated by a second version of this project coming in the future.

## *Project Goals*
This course aims to help us learn about full-stack development and create a functional website.
The project starts with developing the frontend of the website. The main focus is designing a website with functionality implemented and later improving the website visually. Backend is the final piece, with databases and API calls galore.
